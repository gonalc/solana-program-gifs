## Updating the program

For updating the program, the best way to go is the following:

* Update the code.

* Run `anchor test` for testing the new code with the tests on `tests/myepicproject.js`.

* When ready, run `anchor deploy` for deploying the changes into devnet.

* Make sure to get the updated **IDL file** for the web app.
